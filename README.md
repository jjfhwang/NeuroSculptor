# NeuroSculptor: Diffusion Tensor Modulation via Neural ODEs

A TypeScript library for generative inference and targeted adversarial robustness explorations by modulating diffusion tensors via Neural Ordinary Differential Equations.

NeuroSculptor provides a novel framework for manipulating the diffusion process inherent in generative models. At its core, this library leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn and apply targeted modifications to the diffusion tensor. This allows for fine-grained control over the generative process, enabling applications ranging from generating specific types of data samples to enhancing the adversarial robustness of diffusion models against targeted attacks. By directly influencing the diffusion process, NeuroSculptor offers a more intuitive and efficient approach compared to traditional adversarial training techniques that often require extensive retraining and can compromise generative quality.

The primary benefit of using NeuroSculptor lies in its ability to explore and exploit the latent space of diffusion models with unprecedented precision. By learning mappings that sculpt the diffusion tensor, we can bias the generation process towards desired outcomes, such as generating images with specific features or enhancing the model's resilience to adversarial perturbations. This framework is particularly relevant in scenarios where data security and model robustness are paramount, as it provides a mechanism to proactively address vulnerabilities and mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks. Furthermore, the Neural ODE-based approach offers a continuous representation of the diffusion process, allowing for efficient optimization and adaptation to different generative models and data distributions.

NeuroSculptor distinguishes itself through its modular design, allowing for easy integration with existing diffusion model implementations. The library provides a set of pre-trained Neural ODE modules for common image datasets and architectures, along with tools for training custom modules tailored to specific tasks. The TypeScript implementation ensures type safety and maintainability, making it easier for developers to extend and customize the framework. The focus on interpretable diffusion tensor manipulation provides insights into the generative process, enabling a deeper understanding of how diffusion models learn and generalize. This allows for the discovery of novel adversarial attack strategies and the development of more robust defense mechanisms.

## Key Features

*   **Diffusion Tensor Modulation:** Implements Neural ODEs to learn and apply targeted modifications to the diffusion tensor, influencing the generative process.
*   **Generative Inference Steering:** Enables control over the generated samples by biasing the diffusion process towards desired characteristics or features. This is achieved by modulating the drift and diffusion coefficients based on the learned Neural ODE.
*   **Adversarial Robustness Enhancement:** Provides a framework for enhancing the robustness of diffusion models against targeted adversarial attacks by learning to counteract adversarial perturbations in the diffusion space. This is implemented through adversarial training of the Neural ODE itself, focusing on robustness against specific attacks.
*   **Modular Design:** Facilitates easy integration with existing diffusion model implementations, supporting various architectures and datasets. The core modules are designed with clear interfaces for easy swapping and extension.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** Ensures type safety and maintainability, allowing for easier extension and customization of the framework. The codebase is thoroughly documented with type annotations and JSDoc comments.
*   **Pre-trained Models:** Offers pre-trained Neural ODE modules for common image datasets and architectures, providing a starting point for experimentation and application. These models are available for download and can be easily integrated into existing workflows.
*   **Customizable Training:** Provides tools for training custom Neural ODE modules tailored to specific tasks and datasets. Includes flexible training loops and loss functions for optimizing the diffusion tensor modulation.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Used for writing the core library, ensuring type safety and maintainability. Provides static typing, which enhances code quality and reduces the risk of runtime errors.
*   **TensorFlow.js:** Used for implementing the Neural ODEs and manipulating tensors in the browser or Node.js environment. Provides a flexible and efficient platform for numerical computation and deep learning.
*   **Node.js:** Used for development, testing, and deployment of the library. Enables server-side rendering and other advanced features.

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be configured:

*   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` for development mode or `production` for production mode. Defaults to `development`.
*   `MODEL_PATH`: Specifies the path to the pre-trained Neural ODE model. Defaults to `./models/default_model.json`.
*   `DATASET_PATH`: Specifies the path to the dataset used for training or inference. Defaults to `./data/default_dataset.json`.
To set these variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project or set them directly in your environment.

## Usage

First, import the necessary modules:



This example demonstrates how to initialize the `DiffusionTensorModulator`, load a pre-trained Neural ODE model (optional), and use it to modulate the diffusion tensor. The `modulate` function takes the current noise tensor and a timestep as input and returns the modulated tensor.
